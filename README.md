# Advent of Code

For my annual feeble attempts at Advent Of Code

### 2022

Late start due to re:Invent again, let's see if I can do more than 8.

### 2021

A bit of a late start this year because of being a re:Invent in Las Vegas, NV. Time to catch up!

### 2020

Oh dear, I read the Day 3 puzzle and didn't know how to make a start, then work took over :man_facepalming:

### 2019

Yeah, I mean it's pretty clear I didn't know what I was doing .....
